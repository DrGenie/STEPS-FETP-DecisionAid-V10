  <h1>STEPS Technical Appendix</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Companion to the STEPS web tool for Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP) scale-up decisions in India.
  </p>

  <p class="part-label">Part A – For decision-makers and FETP leaders</p>
  <p class="part-label">Part B – For technical users</p>

  <p>
    This appendix explains, first in plain language and then in technical detail, how each tab in the STEPS decision aid works,
    how key metrics are calculated, and how to interpret results for India’s FETP scale-up.
  </p>

  <h2>Guide to this appendix</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Part A – What STEPS does and how to read each tab</li>
    <li>Part A – How the individual tabs work in practice</li>
    <li>Part A – Three worked example scenarios (Frontline, Intermediate, Advanced)</li>
    <li>Part A – How STEPS relates to India’s FETP workforce targets</li>
    <li>Part B – Technical structure, formulas and worked calculations</li>

    <li>References used for assumptions and targets</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>1. What problem does STEPS help you solve?</h2>
  <p>
    India has already trained roughly <strong>3,300 field epidemiologists</strong> across the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) and FETP streams.
    The International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005) monitoring framework and the WHO Joint External Evaluation (JEE) use an indicative
    target of <strong>one trained field epidemiologist per 200,000 people</strong> for workforce development.
    For a population of about <strong>1.3 billion</strong>, this implies a long-run need for around
    <strong>6,500 Intermediate or Advanced-level field epidemiologists</strong> in India.<sup>1</sup>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>“One India” FETP roadmap</strong>, launched by NCDC in 2023, sets out a vision to bring all FETP streams under one umbrella and
    extend field epidemiology coverage to all districts by 2030, using a three-tier cascade from Frontline to Intermediate
    and Advanced programmes.<sup>2</sup>
  </p>

  <div class="callout positive">
    <strong>STEPS in one sentence:</strong>
    STEPS translates complex training and costing choices into a small set of decision-ready scenarios showing
    value for money, feasibility and capacity requirements, and the risks if scale-up is too fast or under-resourced.
  </div>

  <h2>2. How should I move through the STEPS tabs?</h2>

  <ul class="step-list">
    <li><span class="inline-label">Step 1 → Start with the story and options.</span>
      Use the <strong>Introduction</strong> and <strong>Attributes and levels</strong> tabs to remind yourself what each tier of FETP does,
      what levers you can change (mentorship, delivery mode, qualification, scale), and how these affect stakeholder support and costs.
    </li>
    <li><span class="inline-label">Step 2 → Set the rules of the game.</span>
      On the <strong>Settings</strong> tab you set the assumptions: planning horizon, discount rate, available mentors and sites,
      and how much value you attach to outbreak responses and to graduates. These inputs change all tabs downstream.
    </li>
    <li><span class="inline-label">Step 3 → Configure one scenario.</span>
      The <strong>Configuration</strong> tab is where you choose a tier (Frontline, Intermediate, Advanced), mentorship intensity,
      delivery mode, qualification type, cohort size, number of cohorts and monthly costs. Clicking
      <em>Apply configuration</em> generates a full scenario.
    </li>
    <li><span class="inline-label">Step 4 → Read the results and feasibility.</span>
      The <strong>Results</strong>, <strong>Costing details</strong> and <strong>National simulation</strong> tabs summarise endorsement,
      perceived programme value, costs, epidemiological benefits, benefit–cost ratios (BCRs), and whether mentor and site capacity is adequate.
    </li>
    <li><span class="inline-label">Step 5 → Stress-test endorsement and value.</span>
      The <strong>Perceived programme value / Sensitivity</strong> tab shows how endorsement and perceived value change when you tweak key attributes.
      It is built from discrete-choice experiment (DCE) results and lets you see which levers matter most.
    </li>
    <li><span class="inline-label">Step 6 → Save and export scenarios.</span>
      The <strong>Saved scenarios</strong> tab keeps a table of your own scenarios and the model-generated <strong>Top-5 recommended scenarios</strong>.
      The <strong>Copilot briefing</strong> tab generates policy-ready prompts and text for reports, and the export buttons produce meeting-ready
      PDF/Word/Excel summaries.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How does each STEPS tab work in practice?</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Introduction tab – What questions does STEPS answer for me?</h3>
  <p>
    The Introduction tab answers three high-level questions for senior officials:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="question">Why invest now?</span>
      It links FETP scale-up to India’s commitments under IHR (2005), the One India FETP roadmap and health security priorities.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">What can we change?</span>
      It summarises the main levers you can adjust: scale (cohorts and trainees), mentorship intensity, delivery mode,
      qualification type and cost.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">What does “good” look like?</span>
      It explains that STEPS does not predict the future, but organises evidence so you can compare packages of options transparently.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The colour cues used in later tabs are introduced here:
    <span class="badge badge-green">Green</span> for broadly favourable, feasible options;
    <span class="badge badge-amber">Amber</span> where trade-offs need discussion; and
    <span class="badge badge-red">Red</span> where cost or capacity is a serious concern.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Attributes and levels – What levers does the model recognise?</h3>
  <p>
    This tab explains, in plain language, each attribute used in the DCE and in the scenario engine:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Programme tier</strong> (Frontline, Intermediate, Advanced) with indicative duration: 3, 12 and 24 months respectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentorship intensity</strong> (low, medium, high), which drives both quality and the number of trainees each mentor can support.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery mode</strong> (fully in-person, blended), affecting costs and perceived value.</li>
    <li><strong>Qualification</strong> (certificate vs university qualification), influencing career incentives.</li>
    <li><strong>Cohort size and number of cohorts</strong>, driving scale, costs and graduates.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentor support costs and site capacity</strong>, which underpin feasibility.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For each attribute, the tab briefly notes how stakeholders in the DCE responded – for example, that higher mentorship and recognised
    university qualifications generally increased endorsement, but at higher cost.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Settings tab – What assumptions sit behind the numbers?</h3>
  <p>
    The Settings tab answers: <em>“Under what economic and capacity assumptions do these scenarios hold?”</em> It is divided into:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Planning horizon and discount rate.</strong>
      By default, the horizon is set to 1 year and the discount rate to 3%.
      You can extend the horizon if you are planning a multi-year roadmap, and all net present value (NPV) calculations update automatically.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Epidemiological value assumptions.</strong>
      Defaults specify the completion rate, expected number of outbreak responses per graduate per year,
      and the indicative monetary value of averted outbreaks (for example, completion 90%, 0.5 outbreak responses per graduate per year,
      and an indicative value of INR 4,000,000 per significant outbreak response). These are user-adjustable.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Capacity and costs.</strong>
      You specify how many mentors and training sites are realistically available nationally, and any base mentor support cost per cohort.
      These inputs drive the feasibility classification in the capacity panels and the mentor shortfall metrics.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>What happens when you change an assumption?</strong><br>
    Every time you change a setting and apply it, STEPS records this in the session log and recomputes the value, cost, NPV and feasibility
    metrics for all active and saved scenarios, and for the Top-5 recommended scenarios.
  </div>

  <h3>3.4 Configuration tab – How do I build a scenario?</h3>
  <p>
    The Configuration tab is where you design one “policy package” at a time. You:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Choose a programme tier: Frontline, Intermediate, or Advanced.</li>
    <li>Select mentorship intensity, delivery mode and qualification type.</li>
    <li>Set trainees per cohort and number of cohorts.</li>
    <li>Enter monthly cost per trainee and any mentor support cost per cohort.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    STEPS applies simple logic checks so that the planning horizon, tier duration and number of cohorts remain coherent. For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontline</strong> has a 3-month duration. With a 1-year horizon, up to 4 cohorts are feasible; the default cohorts value reflects this.</li>
    <li><strong>Intermediate</strong> has a 12-month duration. With a 1-year horizon, you can only run one full cohort per site at a time.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced</strong> has a 24-month duration. Choosing this tier prompts a minimum 2-year horizon and constrains the minimum number of cohorts.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After you click <em>Apply configuration</em>, the tool generates:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A qualitative message such as
      <span class="badge badge-green">Promising configuration</span>,
      <span class="badge badge-amber">Needs discussion</span> or
      <span class="badge badge-red">Challenging configuration</span>,
      based on endorsement, BCR and whether willingness-to-pay (WTP) proxies exceed costs.
    </li>
    <li>Mentor and site capacity metrics (required mentors per cohort, required mentors nationally, mentor shortfall).</li>
    <li>Updated costs, benefits and NPVs used throughout the rest of the tool.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.5 Results tab – What do “endorsement” and “value” mean?</h3>
  <p>
    The Results tab answers two core questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="question">How much support is there for this configuration?</span>
      Endorsement is the predicted share of stakeholders who would support the option, based on the DCE preference estimates
      and your selected attribute levels.
    </li>
    <li><span class="question">Is the option good value for money?</span>
      Perceived programme value converts stakeholder preferences into an equivalent monetary value using a WTP scale.
      This is compared with economic costs to compute net benefit and BCR.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The tab also provides a short feasibility summary for each scenario, showing:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>whether the option is within mentor and site capacity or requires capacity expansion;</li>
    <li>mentor shortfall in absolute numbers; and</li>
    <li>a short narrative linking cost, value and feasibility (for example, “Less support and WTP below cost” versus
      “Strong value but requires substantial mentor expansion”).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.6 Costing details tab – Where does the money go?</h3>
  <p>
    The Costing details tab disaggregates the total economic cost per cohort and nationally into logical components, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>trainee-related costs (stipends, travel, accommodation where included in the input data);</li>
    <li>mentor support costs based on the per-cohort input and the number of mentors per cohort implied by mentorship intensity;</li>
    <li>institutional or university fees, if relevant for degree-granting variants.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These items sum to the economic cost lines shown in the Results and National simulation tabs, ensuring that figures are internally consistent.
  </p>

  <h3>3.7 National simulation tab – How does this scale nationally?</h3>
  <p>
    Once you are comfortable with one scenario, the National simulation tab helps you ask:
    <em>“What happens if we run this across India?”</em> It:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>scales costs and benefits to the selected number of cohorts and planning horizon;</li>
    <li>reports required mentors per cohort, required mentors nationally, available mentors nationally (from the Settings tab),
      and the resulting mentor shortfall; and</li>
    <li>summarises feasibility as <strong>Within capacity</strong> or <strong>Requires capacity expansion</strong>, with a short explanation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.8 Perceived programme value / Sensitivity tab – Which levers move endorsement?</h3>
  <p>
    This tab answers: <em>“If we change one feature of the programme, how does support change?”</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It shows the baseline endorsement and perceived programme value for the current configuration.</li>
    <li>It then shows how those numbers change when you vary key attributes (for example, moving from low to high mentorship
      or from certificate to university qualification), holding other factors constant.</li>
    <li>Epidemiological benefits are intentionally not shown in this sensitivity table, so that you can focus on stakeholder support
      and perceived value.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.9 Copilot briefing tab – How do I turn results into a narrative?</h3>
  <p>
    Senior policymakers often ask for slide decks, short briefs or talking points. The Copilot briefing tab automates much of this by generating:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a concise, plain-language summary of the current configuration;</li>
    <li>a structured description of your saved scenarios, including which ones are shortlisted;</li>
    <li>a separate summary of the <strong>Top-5 recommended scenarios</strong> generated by the model logic (value for money and feasibility),
      clearly labelled as Recommended scenarios; and</li>
    <li>ready-to-use prompts for Copilot and ChatGPT that combine these scenario descriptions with clear instructions for generating
      policy briefs, slide packs or more detailed reports.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When you click the buttons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Copy prompt for Copilot / ChatGPT</strong> – the tailored prompt, including scenario summaries and Top-5 recommendations,
      is copied to your clipboard and a green confirmation popup appears.</li>
    <li><strong>Download prompts</strong> – saves a simple text or Word file containing the same prompts.</li>
    <li><strong>Open Copilot and copy</strong> or <strong>Open ChatGPT and copy</strong> – opens the relevant service in a new browser tab
      and keeps the prompt on your clipboard so that you can paste it directly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If no scenario has been saved, the popup appears in red, explaining that at least one scenario is needed before prompts can be generated.
    This prevents empty or uninformative reports.
  </p>

  <h3>3.10 Saved scenarios tab – How do I compare and export?</h3>
  <p>
    The Saved scenarios tab is the “control room” for decision-making. It has two main components:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your saved scenarios.</strong>
      Every time you save a configuration, it appears in the table with endorsement, perceived programme value, economic cost,
      epidemiological benefits (where relevant), net benefit, BCR, feasibility status and mentor shortfall.
      For each scenario, the tool stores automatically generated <strong>Enablers</strong> and <strong>Risks</strong>, which are also used in exports
      and in the Copilot prompts.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Top-5 recommended scenarios.</strong>
      These are computed independently from the model logic and labelled as Recommended scenarios.
      They do not replace or overwrite your saved scenarios; they sit alongside them to guide discussions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Export options include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Standard export</strong> – a multi-page PDF or Word document summarising all saved scenarios, enablers, risks and capacity implications.</li>
    <li><strong>Brief export (two pages)</strong> – a concise PDF or Word summary focused on the Top-5 recommended scenarios and any shortlisted user scenarios,
      including an Enablers box and a Risks box auto-filled from the tool.</li>
    <li><strong>Top-5 export</strong> – PDF, Word or Excel exports that contain only the five recommended scenarios for rapid discussion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How do three concrete scenarios look in STEPS?</h2>
  <p>
    To make the mechanics tangible, the table below uses three illustrative configurations. For simplicity, we assume a cohort size of 35 trainees
    for Frontline and Intermediate and 25 for Advanced. The actual endorsement, value and BCR figures are generated automatically inside STEPS
    once you enter the same configurations.

    <strong>Key take-away for policymakers:</strong>
    The three options illustrate a basic trade-off: Frontline FETP expands coverage quickly at lower cost per trainee but does not close
    the IHR Intermediate/Advanced gap; Intermediate builds the district and state backbone; Advanced is more expensive and mentor-intensive
    but essential for high-level leadership and for sustaining quality across the cascade. STEPS helps you adjust cohort sizes,
    numbers and mentorship intensities within each of these options to see which portfolio gives the best balance of coverage,
    value for money and feasibility.
  </div>

  <h2>5. How can India move from 3,300 to 6,500 field epidemiologists?</h2>
  <p>
    Using the IHR target of 1 field epidemiologist per 200,000 population and a population of 1.3 billion,
    India’s long-run need is approximately:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Required Intermediate/Advanced epidemiologists = 1,300,000,000 / 200,000 = 6,500
  </p>
  <p>
    If we treat 3,300 as the current stock of Intermediate and Advanced-equivalent epidemiologists, the additional requirement is around
    <strong>3,200 graduates</strong> over the next several years.
  </p>

  <h3>5.1 An illustrative multi-year pathway</h3>
  <p>
    As an illustration, suppose that between now and 2030 India runs, across a national network of accredited institutions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>10 Intermediate cohorts per year, each with 35 trainees;</li>
    <li>6 Advanced cohorts per year, each with 25 trainees;</li>
    <li>a completion rate of 90% for both tiers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The resulting annual flow of Intermediate/Advanced graduates would be:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Graduates per year = 0.9 × (10 × 35 + 6 × 25) = 0.9 × (350 + 150) = 0.9 × 500 = 450 graduates per year
  </p>
  <p>
    Sustained over seven years, this yields approximately:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    450 × 7 = 3,150 additional Intermediate/Advanced-level graduates
  </p>
  <p>
    Adding these to the existing stock of about 3,300 would bring India close to the 6,500 benchmark.
    The exact configuration can be adjusted inside STEPS to align with budget envelopes, mentor availability and institutional capacity.
  </p>

  <h3>5.2 What does this imply for mentors?</h3>
  <p>
    If Intermediate uses medium mentorship and Advanced uses high mentorship, then:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Intermediate mentors per cohort: <span class="formula">N_cohort = ceil(35 / 3.5) = 10</span>.</li>
    <li>Advanced mentors per cohort: <span class="formula">N_cohort = ceil(25 / 2) = 13</span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With 10 Intermediate and 6 Advanced cohorts per year, the implied mentor slots per year are:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Mentors required per year (slots) = 10 × 10 + 13 × 6 = 100 + 78 = 178
  </p>
  <p>
    This simple calculation does not yet account for mentors supporting multiple cohorts or for staggered schedules across institutions.
    STEPS uses the same mentor-per-cohort logic but allows you to specify the available mentor pool and quickly see whether the proposed
    scale-up is within capacity or requires deliberate mentor development.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Using STEPS to test the roadmap:</strong>
    In practice, you can set the Intermediate and Advanced configurations in STEPS to match any proposed roadmap, enter realistic mentor
    and site numbers in the Settings tab, and then use the National simulation and Saved scenarios tabs to see whether the pathway
    is affordable, feasible and aligned with endorsement patterns from the preference study.
  </div>

  <h2>6. How is STEPS structured for technical users?</h2>
  <p>
    Part B sets out the main calculations underpinning the tool. The notation is kept simple to make it easy to translate into
    other software if needed.
  </p>

  <h3>6.1 Core configuration variables</h3>
  <p>
    For each scenario, STEPS stores the following key variables:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tier <span class="formula">g</span> in {frontline, intermediate, advanced}.</li>
    <li>Programme duration in months <span class="formula">M_g</span> (3, 12, 24 respectively).</li>
    <li>Mentorship intensity <span class="formula">m</span> in {low, medium, high}.</li>
    <li>Trainees per cohort <span class="formula">T</span>.</li>
    <li>Number of cohorts <span class="formula">C</span>.</li>
    <li>Monthly cost per trainee <span class="formula">c_trainee</span>.</li>
    <li>Mentor support cost per cohort <span class="formula">c_mentor</span> (optional, can be zero).</li>
    <li>Available mentors nationally <span class="formula">A_mentor</span>.</li>
    <li>Planning horizon in years <span class="formula">H</span>.</li>
    <li>Discount rate <span class="formula">r</span> (default 0.03 per year).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6.2 Mentor capacity and shortfall</h3>
  <p>
    The tool maps mentorship intensity to an implied number of trainees per mentor, using a simple function f(m):
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    f(m) = 2 if m = high; 3.5 if m = medium; 5 if m = low.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given <span class="formula">T</span> trainees per cohort, the required mentors per cohort <span class="formula">N_cohort</span> is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_cohort = ceil( T / f(m) )
  </p>
  <p>
    The total mentor requirement for the scenario (ignoring detailed timing overlap) is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_total = N_cohort × C
  </p>
  <p>
    and the implied mentor shortfall is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Shortfall = max( 0, N_total − A_mentor )
  </p>
  <p>
    These quantities feed into the feasibility status and the capacity summaries shown in the National simulation and Results tabs.
  </p>

  <h3>6.3 Economic costs</h3>
  <p>
    Ignoring more detailed cost components, the basic building blocks are:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Direct trainee cost per cohort:</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_trainee, cohort = T × M_g × c_trainee
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Mentor support cost per cohort:</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_mentor, cohort = c_mentor
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Total cost per cohort:</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_cohort = Cost_trainee, cohort + Cost_mentor, cohort + overheads
  </p>
  <p>
    where "overheads" include institutional or university-level costs if they are specified in the input templates.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Total cost across cohorts:</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_total = C × Cost_cohort
  </p>
  <p>
    In the actual STEPS implementation, these costs are further split into sub-components for reporting, but the core logic is the same.
  </p>

  <h3>6.4 Epidemiological benefits and net present value</h3>
  <p>
    For each tier g, the epidemiological settings specify:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Completion rate <span class="formula">pi_g</span> (for example 0.9).</li>
    <li>Expected outbreak responses per graduate per year <span class="formula">lambda_g</span> (for example 0.5).</li>
    <li>Indicative value per outbreak response <span class="formula">v_out,g</span> (for example INR 4,000,000).</li>
    <li>Any additional value per graduate <span class="formula">v_grad,g</span> (default 0 unless specified).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The effective number of graduates per cohort is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    G_cohort = pi_g × T
  </p>
  <p>
    With C cohorts, the total graduates are:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    G_total = G_cohort × C
  </p>
  <p>
    The expected number of outbreak responses per year from one cohort is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Outbreaks_per_year, cohort = G_cohort × lambda_g
  </p>
  <p>
    The annual outbreak benefit per cohort (in nominal terms) is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_out, annual = Outbreaks_per_year, cohort × v_out,g
  </p>
  <p>
    If benefits are treated as a constant stream over H years with discount rate r, the present value factor is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    PV_factor = sum over t = 1 to H of [ 1 / (1 + r)^t ]
  </p>
  <p>
    The present value of outbreak benefits per cohort is then:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_out, PV, cohort = B_out, annual × PV_factor
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is an additional per-graduate benefit v_grad,g, the present value of graduate benefits per cohort is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_grad, PV, cohort = G_cohort × v_grad,g
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool also allows an optional cross-sector multiplier k (for example to reflect One Health co-benefits), trimmed to a plausible range
    such as 0.8 to 2.0. The epidemiological benefit for the cohort is:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_epi, cohort = k × ( B_out, PV, cohort + B_grad, PV, cohort )
  </p>
  <p>
    Multiplying by the number of cohorts gives the total epidemiological benefit for the scenario.
  </p>

  <h3>6.5 Perceived programme value and endorsement from the DCE</h3>
  <p>
    The DCE underpinning STEPS estimates preference weights beta_k for each attribute level x_k. For a given configuration,
    a utility index is computed as:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    U = beta_0 + sum over k of ( beta_k × x_k )
  </p>
  <p>
    Endorsement is then modelled as a logistic transformation of this utility relative to a reference option with utility U_ref:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Endorsement = 1 / ( 1 + exp( − (U − U_ref) ) )
  </p>
  <p>
    Perceived programme value is obtained by dividing all beta_k and beta_0 by a cost coefficient beta_cost to convert utilities
    into rupee-equivalent WTP. This WTP is then scaled by the number of trainees and cohorts to express it as an indicative monetary value
    comparable to economic costs.
  </p>

  <h3>6.6 Net benefit and benefit–cost ratio</h3>
  <p>
    STEPS reports net benefit and BCR in two main ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>using perceived programme value as a WTP-based monetary benefit proxy; and</li>
    <li>using epidemiological benefits from the outbreak and graduate calculations where these are specified.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For a given definition of benefit B and total economic cost C, the key indicators are:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Net benefit = B − C
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    BCR = B / C
  </p>
  <p>
    These metrics are computed at the cohort level and at the national level for the selected number of cohorts and horizon.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Worked calculations for the three example scenarios</h2>
  <p>
    This section walks through the basic computations for the three options introduced in Part A, focusing on quantities that do not depend
    on the detailed DCE coefficients.
  </p>

  <h3>7.1 Option 1 – Frontline, medium mentorship, certificate, fully in-person, INR 90,000/month</h3>
  <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tier: Frontline (M_frontline = 3 months).</li>
    <li>Mentorship: medium (f(m) = 3.5 trainees per mentor).</li>
    <li>Trainees per cohort: T = 35.</li>
    <li>Number of cohorts: C = 4 within a 1-year horizon.</li>
    <li>Monthly cost per trainee: c_trainee = 90,000 INR.</li>
    <li>Mentor support cost per cohort: c_mentor = 0 (for illustration).</li>
    <li>Available mentors nationally: A_mentor = 200 (illustrative input).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Calculations:</strong></p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_cohort = ceil(35 / 3.5) = 10 mentors per cohort
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_total = 10 × 4 = 40 mentor slots
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Shortfall = max(0, 40 − 200) = 0
  </p>
  <p>
    Direct trainee cost per cohort:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_trainee, cohort = 35 × 3 × 90,000 = 9,450,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    Total cost across 4 cohorts (ignoring overheads):
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_total = 4 × 9,450,000 = 37,800,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    In STEPS, these calculations inform the cost and capacity panels, while endorsement and perceived value panels use the DCE coefficients
    to determine whether the configuration is broadly attractive to stakeholders.
  </p>

  <h3>7.2 Option 2 – Intermediate, medium mentorship, university qualification, fully in-person, INR 100,000/month</h3>
  <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tier: Intermediate (M_intermediate = 12 months).</li>
    <li>Mentorship: medium (f(m) = 3.5 trainees per mentor).</li>
    <li>Trainees per cohort: T = 35.</li>
    <li>Number of cohorts: C = 3 across the planning horizon.</li>
    <li>Monthly cost per trainee: c_trainee = 100,000 INR.</li>
    <li>Mentor support cost per cohort: c_mentor = 0 (for illustration).</li>
    <li>Completion rate: pi_intermediate = 0.9.</li>
    <li>Outbreak responses per graduate per year: lambda_intermediate = 0.5.</li>
    <li>Value per outbreak response: v_out, intermediate = 4,000,000 INR.</li>
    <li>Planning horizon: H = 5 years (NPV illustration).</li>
    <li>Discount rate: r = 0.03.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Calculations:</strong></p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_cohort = ceil(35 / 3.5) = 10 mentors per cohort
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_total = 10 × 3 = 30 mentor slots
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_trainee, cohort = 35 × 12 × 100,000 = 42,000,000 INR
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_total = 3 × 42,000,000 = 126,000,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduates per cohort:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    G_cohort = 0.9 × 35 = 31.5
  </p>
  <p>
    Outbreak responses per year per cohort:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Outbreaks_per_year, cohort = 31.5 × 0.5 = 15.75
  </p>
  <p>
    Annual outbreak benefit per cohort:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_out, annual = 15.75 × 4,000,000 = 63,000,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    Present value factor over 5 years at 3% (approximate):
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    PV_factor ≈ 4.58
  </p>
  <p>
    Outbreak PV per cohort (without cross-sector multiplier):
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_out, PV, cohort ≈ 63,000,000 × 4.58 ≈ 288,540,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    In STEPS, this is combined with any specified graduate-specific value and cross-sector multipliers, and then compared
    with the total economic cost to compute net benefit and BCR.
  </p>

  <h3>7.3 Option 3 – Advanced, high mentorship, university qualification, fully in-person, INR 120,000/month</h3>
  <p><strong>Assumptions:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tier: Advanced (M_advanced = 24 months).</li>
    <li>Mentorship: high (f(m) = 2 trainees per mentor).</li>
    <li>Trainees per cohort: T = 25.</li>
    <li>Number of cohorts: C = 2.</li>
    <li>Monthly cost per trainee: c_trainee = 120,000 INR.</li>
    <li>Mentor support cost per cohort: c_mentor = 0 (for illustration).</li>
    <li>Completion rate: pi_advanced = 0.9.</li>
    <li>Outbreak responses per graduate per year: lambda_advanced = 0.5.</li>
    <li>Value per outbreak response: v_out, advanced = 4,000,000 INR.</li>
    <li>Planning horizon: H = 5 years from the point where a steady state of graduates is reached.</li>
    <li>Discount rate: r = 0.03.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Calculations:</strong></p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_cohort = ceil(25 / 2) = 13 mentors per cohort
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    N_total = 13 × 2 = 26 mentor slots
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_trainee, cohort = 25 × 24 × 120,000 = 72,000,000 INR
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Cost_total = 2 × 72,000,000 = 144,000,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduates per cohort:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    G_cohort = 0.9 × 25 = 22.5
  </p>
  <p>
    Outbreak responses per year per cohort:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    Outbreaks_per_year, cohort = 22.5 × 0.5 = 11.25
  </p>
  <p>
    Annual outbreak benefit per cohort:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_out, annual = 11.25 × 4,000,000 = 45,000,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    Outbreak PV per cohort over 5 years at 3%:
  </p>
  <p class="formula">
    B_out, PV, cohort ≈ 45,000,000 × 4.58 ≈ 206,100,000 INR
  </p>
  <p>
    These figures show why Advanced training is costly but can still be highly cost-effective when targeted appropriately,
    especially once additional leadership and system-strengthening benefits are taken into account.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Using new evidence in STEPS:</strong>
    If new empirical evidence emerges on completion rates, outbreak response frequency or monetary values,
    these parameters can be updated directly in the Settings tab. The tool will then recalculate all NPVs, net benefits
    and BCRs without changing the underlying DCE preference structure.
